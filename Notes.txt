SAP Authentication
SAP backend (=>APIs) are stateless and decoupled from front end 2servers
we can do Authentication by json web token generated on server hashed on successful login and send back to frontend where we can store it in angular app cookie/localstorage
that token is attached to future requests as part of url or header, that token cann't be faked only server can decode it.

104:- depending on the token we need to protect few routes
in posts routes add/edit/delete needs to be protected

to proetect the route we will use an extra middleware to autheticate the request

110:- we will route guards to avoid user to got to any particular page via url as he/she is not authenticated to use the page

111:- token expires in 1h that fronent doen't know, we have to inform frontend the same thing
